					<h5>Main Points</h5>
					<p>Graham is a 32-year old man, working in marketing. His tasks at work are usually quite stressful, since he has to
						coordinate an entire team of employees.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="leftGroup">
					<h5>Goals</h5>
	
						<p>Personal Goals: He wants to relax watching a comedy movie after a long and exhausting day at work.</p>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div class="leftGroup">
					<h5>Frustrations and Pain Points</h5>
					<p>Lately, he has realized that he has seen almost every comedy movie. He became tired of searching for movies, so 
						he has started browsing for sites that recommend movies.
					</p>
					</ul>

				<h5>Detailed Description</h5>
				<p><strong>"A persona is a user archetype you can use to help guide decisions about product features, navigation, interactions, and even visual design." (Kim Goodwin, Cooper.com)</strong></p>
				<br>
				<p>He is frustrated by the fact that the other employees make his job harder
					than it should actually be. So, at the end of the day, the only things that make him happy are his dogs and a good, relaxing movie
					on his laptop.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>He does this every night. Eat popcorn, cuddle with the dog on the sofa and watch a good movie. He has seen so many movies that he doesn't
					know what to watch anymore.

			<h5>Scenarios</h5>
			<p>One day, he came home after work stressed because one of the employees he coordinates erased all of the data and information
				that Graham and his team worked on that day. So, he had to redo all of his work the next day. Just the thought of having to deal
				with all of those tasks once again made him anxious and angry. But he couldn't do anything about it except accepting the situation
				and relax. The deed was done. So, he played a bit with Tarzan, his dog, and later he searched a comedy movie on this site, MoviePicker.
				He felt way better after that and the next day at work he was more relaxed.

			<p>Yesterday, he came home after a long day at work, all happy. All of a sudden, he noticed in a corner of the apartment his cat's favorite toy.
				He remembered all the memories he had with his cat and his mood shifted, he was now sad. He decided to watch a movie, a fantasy one but he didn't know which one.
				So, he entered MoviePicker and let it do the search for him. He was happier after the movie was done.

					<h5>Main Points</h5>
					<p>Harper is a 25-year old woman, working in an agency. She likes what she does at work, having to

				</div>
				<div class="leftGroup">

				<p><strong>"A persona is a user archetype you can use to help guide decisions about product features, navigation, interactions, and even visual design." (Kim Goodwin, Cooper.com)</strong></p>
				<br>
				<p>She feels captivated by watching a SF movie, she almost wishes she was there to witness an apocalypse or befriending
					an alien.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>She likes watching those kind of movies all alone, because she finds that if there is someone else watching that movie with her,
					the other person talks and she is disrupted. She doesn't like not paying attention to movies.
